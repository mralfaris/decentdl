# DecentDL - Decentralized Driver's License

## Self-Sovereign Identity Solution for Driver’s License

<h2> Project Description </h2>
DecentDL is a solution based on Blockchain Platform Hyperledger Aries/Indy. The solution offers issuance and verification features of Driver's Licenses by relying on the capabilities of Self-Sovereign Identity Solution.

With Self-Sovereign Identity the users are having full control over their identity attributes and they decide when, what and with whom to share 
their Driver's License data.

<h2> Problem </h2>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Centralized identity</strong> and credentials management systems are considered as honeypot for cyberattacks. </li>
    <li> There are issues with <strong>physical identity verification</strong> (tampering, identity-theft). </li>
    <li> <strong>Consumers</strong> view and store personal information more than they require. </li>    
    <li> Newly introduced <strong>privacy regulations</strong> are endangering companies reputation when they deal with person’s data. </li>
</ul>
